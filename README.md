# Agile, Scrum and Kanban  

## Agile
Agile is a project management methodology which focusses upon an iterative approach. 
The Agile Manifesto which details the values and principles around which Agile centres. Agile has 12 principles which can be collated under 4 values. These values are:
1. Individuals and Interaction over processes and tools – Promoting team cohesion
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation – Focussing upon the building and testing rather than creating large documents. This is reflected in the practice of creating Epics and User Stories which typically summate tasks on a single sticky note, as opposed to swathes of documentation. 
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation – Involving the customer in the process.
4. Responding to change over following a plan – Being flexible and adaptable.
